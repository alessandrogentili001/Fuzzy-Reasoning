This repository explores two fundamental fuzzy learning techniques:

1. Fuzzy K-Means (FKM) for clustering, allowing overlapping cluster memberships.
2. Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbors (Fuzzy K-NN) for classification, leveraging soft memberships to classify data with inherent uncertainty.

The project emphasizes the theoretical underpinnings, algorithmic details, hyperparameter tuning, and practical applications of these methods in various scenarios.
